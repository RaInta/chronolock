# ChronoLock

Lock in time. Unlock expertise on an expert's calendar.

ChronoLock is a lightweight service for **locking, selling, and releasing time** on a personal calendar.

It enables individuals to advertise availability, accept payment via **x402**, and automatically convert paid bookings into confirmed calendar events. This is with Google Calendar initially, but designed to be calendar-agnostic.

Your time is valuable. So value it! ChronoLock treats time as an ownable resource:
- Availability is discoverable
- Access is managed
- Payment is atomic
- Booking is frictionless

No marketplaces, no intermediaries, and **no subscriptions**.  
Instead, paid access to attention, expertise, or presence at a fair market rate.

## Core ideas

- **Time as a resource**: availability is published, not negotiated. OK, maybe it can be negotiated
- **Payment-gated access**: slots unlock only after escrow deposit. Payment is only made once the calendar event has occurred
- **Hold and confirm semantics**: temporary locks prevent double-booking
- **Minimal trust surface**: calendars remain the source of truth
- **Composable by design**: works with agents, MCP tools, and automation

ChronoLock is intended as infrastructure, not a platform.
